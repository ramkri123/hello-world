## 1. Privacy-Preserving Consortium Collaboration
### 1.1 Executive Summary
Fraud detection is a leading example of privacy-preserving collaboration in the financial services vertical, but the consortium-based approach described here is broadly applicable across many industries. In this model, a consortium owner (such as SWIFT, ACH networks, or other financial messaging providers) can host a privacy-preserving service where participants (e.g., banks) collaborate on high-value transaction screening without exposing sensitive data or model weights. This approach balances collaborative intelligence with strict privacy requirements, making it viable for large institutions under heavy regulatory constraints. Similar privacy-preserving consortium models can be applied in healthcare, insurance, telecommunications, energy, supply chain, and other sectors where sensitive data must remain protected while enabling collective risk mitigation or intelligence.

## 2. Consortium Vertical Use Cases
While this document focuses on fraud detection as an example use case in the financial services vertical, the consortium-based privacy-preserving approach is broadly applicable across multiple industries. Below are additional verticals and representative use cases:


### 2.1 Financial Services (Example Use Case: Fraud Detection)
2.1.1 **Fraud Detection**: Collaborative screening of high-value transactions across banks without exposing sensitive data or proprietary models.

### 2.2 Healthcare/Medical Consortium
2.2.1 **Collaborative Disease Surveillance**: Hospitals and clinics share anonymized risk scores or model outputs to detect emerging outbreaks or rare disease patterns, while patient data and proprietary algorithms remain private.
2.2.2 **Clinical Trial Matching**: Multiple research institutions aggregate eligibility scores to identify suitable candidates for clinical trials, improving recruitment while preserving patient confidentiality.
2.2.3 **Medical Imaging AI**: Hospitals contribute model outputs (not raw images) to a central aggregator to improve diagnostic accuracy for rare conditions, without sharing patient images or model weights.

### 2.3 Other Potential Verticals
2.3.1 **Insurance**: Cross-company fraud detection, risk scoring, and claims anomaly detection without sharing customer data.
2.3.2 **Telecommunications**: Collaborative spam/fraud call detection using score sharing across carriers.
2.3.3 **Energy**: Grid anomaly detection and predictive maintenance through secure aggregation of risk scores from different utility providers.
2.3.4 **Supply Chain**: Counterfeit detection and risk scoring across manufacturers and logistics partners, preserving proprietary data.

These examples illustrate that the consortium model can enable collective intelligence and risk mitigation in any sector where privacy, regulatory compliance, and competitive sensitivity are paramount.

# 3 Privacy-Preserving Fraud Detection: Consortium Approach
This document outlines a consortium-based approach to privacy-preserving fraud detection, focusing on how banks can collaborate to enhance fraud detection capabilities while maintaining strict data privacy and regulatory compliance. The consortium model allows institutions to share risk scores and insights without exposing sensitive transaction data or proprietary models, leveraging collective intelligence for improved fraud detection.

## 3.1 Consortium-Hosted Fraud & Risk-Scoring Service

The service enables banks to:
- Maintain proprietary fraud models locally
- Share intelligence without exposing raw data
- Leverage network effects for cross-institutional fraud detection
- Comply with regulatory requirements (GLBA, GDPR, CCPA)

## 4. Architecture Options

### 4.1 Score Sharing Consortium (Recommended)

**Process Flow:**
1. Banks train models locally using proprietary data (never leaves bank premises)
2. Banks perform inference locally on transactions (real-time scoring within bank)
3. Only risk scores are shared with the Consortium Owner's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
4. Consortium Owner's enclave aggregates scores for cross-institutional comparison

**Key Principle**: Complete data and model isolation - raw data, model weights, and inference computation all remain within each bank's infrastructure

**Key Benefits:**
- **Minimal Governance Overhead**: Simplified legal framework focused on score semantics
- **Maximum Privacy**: Model weights never leave banks
- **Network Intelligence**: Cross-bank anomaly detection through score aggregation

**Implementation:**
```
Bank A: Local Training → Local Model → Local Inference → Risk Score → Consortium TEE
Bank B: Local Training → Local Model → Local Inference → Risk Score → Consortium TEE  
Bank C: Local Training → Local Model → Local Inference → Risk Score → Consortium TEE

Consortium TEE: Score Aggregation → Comparison Score → Consensus Alert → Banks
```

**Privacy Architecture:**
- **Training**: Happens entirely within bank's secure environment
- **Model Storage**: Models never leave bank premises
- **Inference**: Real-time scoring done locally at each bank
- **Data Sharing**: Only final risk scores (0-1 probability) sent to Consortium TEE
- **No Model Sharing**: Model weights, architecture, and features remain proprietary

### 4.2 Federated Learning in TEE (Premium Security Option)

**Key Principle**: Collective model improvement through secure aggregation in trusted hardware environment, combining the privacy benefits of TEE with the collaborative learning advantages of federated learning.

**Common Security Features (Both Variants):**
- **TEE Attestation**: Cryptographic proof that aggregation occurs in secure environment
- **Memory Isolation**: Hardware-level protection prevents unauthorized access to model data
- **Encrypted Communication**: End-to-end encryption for all transfers
- **Audit Trails**: Immutable logs of all aggregation operations for regulatory compliance

**Common Benefits:**
- **Hardware-Level Security**: TEE provides cryptographic attestation and memory isolation
- **Regulatory Compliance**: TEE attestation provides cryptographic proof of security to auditors
- **Local Training**: All raw data remains within bank premises

**Two Main Variants:**

#### 4.2.1 FL in TEE - Weight Sharing 

**Process Flow:**
1. Banks train models locally using proprietary data (never leaves bank premises)
2. Complete model weights are encrypted and sent to consortium TEE after training epochs
3. TEE performs secure aggregation of model weights from multiple banks
4. Aggregated global model is deployed within the TEE for inference
5. Banks send transaction data to TEE for real-time fraud scoring using the global model

**Implementation:**
```
Bank A: Local Training (Complete) → Encrypted Final Weights → TEE Aggregation Service
Bank B: Local Training (Complete) → Encrypted Final Weights → TEE Aggregation Service
Bank C: Local Training (Complete) → Encrypted Final Weights → TEE Aggregation Service

TEE Aggregation: Secure Weight Averaging → Global Model Deployment in TEE
Banks: Transaction Data → TEE Inference → Risk Scores → Banks
```

**Characteristics:**
- **What moves**: Complete model parameters after local training completion
- **Frequency**: After multiple training rounds (e.g., every 5-10 epochs)
- **Communication**: Lower bandwidth for training, higher for inference
- **TEE Memory**: Requires storage for full model parameters and inference workload
- **Privacy**: Model weights and transaction data processed securely in TEE

#### 4.2.2 FL in TEE - Gradient Sharing

**Process Flow:**
1. Banks train models locally using proprietary data (never leaves bank premises)
2. Gradient updates from training batches are encrypted and sent to consortium TEE
3. TEE performs secure aggregation of gradients from multiple banks
4. Aggregated global model is continuously updated and deployed within the TEE
5. Banks send transaction data to TEE for real-time fraud scoring using the global model

**Implementation:**
```
Bank A: Local Training (Batch) → Encrypted Gradients → TEE Aggregation Service
Bank B: Local Training (Batch) → Encrypted Gradients → TEE Aggregation Service
Bank C: Local Training (Batch) → Encrypted Gradients → TEE Aggregation Service

TEE Aggregation: Secure Gradient Averaging → Global Model Update in TEE
Banks: Transaction Data → TEE Inference → Risk Scores → Banks
```

**Characteristics:**
- **What moves**: Gradient updates from individual training batches
- **Frequency**: More frequent during training (after each batch or epoch)
- **Communication**: Higher bandwidth for both training and inference
- **TEE Memory**: Requires storage for gradient vectors and inference workload
- **Privacy**: Gradients and transaction data processed securely in TEE

**Comparative Analysis:**

| Aspect | FL in TEE - Weight Sharing | FL in TEE - Gradient Sharing |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Communication Frequency** | Low (periodic) | High (frequent) |
| **Bandwidth Requirements** | Medium-High (weights + inference data) | High (gradients + inference data) |
| **TEE Memory Constraints** | Higher (full model + inference) | Lower (gradients + inference) |
| **Privacy Risk** | Lower (complete models in TEE) | Higher (gradients + potential inference attacks) |
| **Training Synchronization** | Loose (epoch-level) | Tight (batch-level) |
| **Implementation Complexity** | Medium | Higher |
| **Convergence Speed** | Slower | Faster |
| **Inference Latency** | Medium (TEE processing) | Medium (TEE processing) |

**Trade-offs (Both Variants):**
- **Higher Complexity**: Requires TEE infrastructure and secure aggregation protocols
- **TEE Dependencies**: Relies on specific hardware (Intel SGX, AMD SEV, ARM TrustZone) availability
- **Performance Overhead**: TEE operations typically have computational overhead
- **Model Size Constraints**: Current TEE memory limitations may restrict large model architectures

**Use Cases:**
- **High-value fraud detection** where model improvement benefits justify additional complexity
- **Cross-border consortiums** requiring cryptographic security proofs for regulators
- **Competitive environments** where banks want collective learning with maximum privacy protection
- **Regulatory-heavy jurisdictions** demanding hardware-attested security guarantees

       "temporal_drift": "monitor_bias_evolution_over_time",
       "feature_importance": "track_discriminative_feature_usage"
     }
   }
   ```

   **Architecture-Specific Auditing**:
   - **Score Sharing Consortium**: Limited to score-level fairness analysis
   - **FL in TEE**: Can analyze model behavior and feature importance across institutions
   - **Clean Room TEE**: Full access for comprehensive fairness analysis

Consortium: Weighted average → Global model → Distribute back
```

**Gradient Aggregation (Alternative):**
- **What moves**: Gradient updates from training batches
- **Frequency**: More frequent during training
- **Trade-off**: Higher communication overhead

### 5.2 Consortium Implementation

**Architecture Components:**
1. **Secure Aggregation Service**: Encrypts weights during transit
2. **Differential Privacy**: Adds noise to weights before sharing
3. **Federated Averaging**: Computes weighted average of bank models
4. **Model Distribution**: Returns updated global model to participants

**Privacy Preservation Methods:**
- Secure multi-party computation (MPC)
- Homomorphic encryption
- Trusted execution environments (TEEs)
- Differential privacy mechanisms

**Fairness and Bias Mitigation Techniques:**
- **Federated Fairness Constraints**: Incorporate fairness metrics into the aggregation process
- **Bias-Aware Averaging**: Weight aggregation based on fairness scores alongside accuracy
- **Cross-Institutional Validation**: Use diversity of participants to detect and correct biases
- **Fairness-Preserving Differential Privacy**: Add noise that maintains both privacy and fairness
- **Demographic Parity Enforcement**: Ensure consistent detection rates across protected groups
- **Adversarial Debiasing**: Include adversarial components to reduce discriminatory patterns

**Implementation Example - Bias-Aware Federated Averaging:**
```python
# Pseudocode for fairness-aware model aggregation
def fairness_aware_aggregation(bank_models, fairness_scores, accuracy_scores):
    # Combine accuracy and fairness into composite score
    composite_scores = alpha * accuracy_scores + (1-alpha) * fairness_scores
    
    # Weight models based on composite performance
    weights = normalize(composite_scores)
    
    # Aggregate with fairness-adjusted weights
    global_model = weighted_average(bank_models, weights)
    
    # Validate global model fairness
    if not meets_fairness_threshold(global_model):
        apply_post_processing_debiasing(global_model)
    
    return global_model
```
