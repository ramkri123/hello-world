## 1. Executive Summary

A consortium owner (such as SWIFT, ACH networks, or other financial messaging providers) could host a privacy-preserving fraud detection service where banks collaborate on high-value transaction screening without exposing sensitive data or model weights. This approach balances collaborative fraud intelligence with strict privacy requirements, making it viable for large financial institutions under heavy regulatory constraints.

## 2. Core Concept

### Consortium-Hosted Fraud & Risk-Scoring Service

The service enables banks to:
- Maintain proprietary fraud models locally
- Share intelligence without exposing raw data
- Leverage network effects for cross-institutional fraud detection
- Comply with regulatory requirements (GLBA, GDPR, CCPA)

## 3. Architecture Options

### 3.1 Score Sharing Consortium (Recommended)

**Process Flow:**
1. Banks train models locally using proprietary data (never leaves bank premises)
2. Banks perform inference locally on transactions (real-time scoring within bank)
3. Only risk scores are shared with the Consortium Owner's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
4. Consortium Owner's enclave aggregates scores for cross-institutional comparison

**Key Principle**: Complete data and model isolation - raw data, model weights, and inference computation all remain within each bank's infrastructure

**Key Benefits:**
- **Minimal Governance Overhead**: Simplified legal framework focused on score semantics
- **Maximum Privacy**: Model weights never leave banks
- **Network Intelligence**: Cross-bank anomaly detection through score aggregation

**Implementation:**
```
Bank A: Local Training → Local Model → Local Inference → Risk Score → Consortium TEE
Bank B: Local Training → Local Model → Local Inference → Risk Score → Consortium TEE  
Bank C: Local Training → Local Model → Local Inference → Risk Score → Consortium TEE

Consortium TEE: Score Aggregation → Comparison Score → Consensus Alert → Banks
```

**Privacy Architecture:**
- **Training**: Happens entirely within bank's secure environment
- **Model Storage**: Models never leave bank premises
- **Inference**: Real-time scoring done locally at each bank
- **Data Sharing**: Only final risk scores (0-1 probability) sent to Consortium TEE
- **No Model Sharing**: Model weights, architecture, and features remain proprietary

### 3.2 Federated Learning in TEE (Premium Security Option)

**Key Principle**: Collective model improvement through secure aggregation in trusted hardware environment, combining the privacy benefits of TEE with the collaborative learning advantages of federated learning.

**Common Security Features (Both Variants):**
- **TEE Attestation**: Cryptographic proof that aggregation occurs in secure environment
- **Memory Isolation**: Hardware-level protection prevents unauthorized access to model data
- **Encrypted Communication**: End-to-end encryption for all transfers
- **Audit Trails**: Immutable logs of all aggregation operations for regulatory compliance

**Common Benefits:**
- **Hardware-Level Security**: TEE provides cryptographic attestation and memory isolation
- **Regulatory Compliance**: TEE attestation provides cryptographic proof of security to auditors
- **Local Training**: All raw data remains within bank premises

**Two Main Variants:**

#### 3.2a FL in TEE - Weight Sharing (Recommended for Banking)

**Process Flow:**
1. Banks train models locally using proprietary data (never leaves bank premises)
2. Complete model weights are encrypted and sent to consortium TEE after training epochs
3. TEE performs secure aggregation of model weights from multiple banks
4. Aggregated global model is deployed within the TEE for inference
5. Banks send transaction data to TEE for real-time fraud scoring using the global model

**Implementation:**
```
Bank A: Local Training (Complete) → Encrypted Final Weights → TEE Aggregation Service
Bank B: Local Training (Complete) → Encrypted Final Weights → TEE Aggregation Service
Bank C: Local Training (Complete) → Encrypted Final Weights → TEE Aggregation Service

TEE Aggregation: Secure Weight Averaging → Global Model Deployment in TEE
Banks: Transaction Data → TEE Inference → Risk Scores → Banks
```

**Characteristics:**
- **What moves**: Complete model parameters after local training completion
- **Frequency**: After multiple training rounds (e.g., every 5-10 epochs)
- **Communication**: Lower bandwidth for training, higher for inference
- **TEE Memory**: Requires storage for full model parameters and inference workload
- **Privacy**: Model weights and transaction data processed securely in TEE

#### 3.2b FL in TEE - Gradient Sharing

**Process Flow:**
1. Banks train models locally using proprietary data (never leaves bank premises)
2. Gradient updates from training batches are encrypted and sent to consortium TEE
3. TEE performs secure aggregation of gradients from multiple banks
4. Aggregated global model is continuously updated and deployed within the TEE
5. Banks send transaction data to TEE for real-time fraud scoring using the global model

**Implementation:**
```
Bank A: Local Training (Batch) → Encrypted Gradients → TEE Aggregation Service
Bank B: Local Training (Batch) → Encrypted Gradients → TEE Aggregation Service
Bank C: Local Training (Batch) → Encrypted Gradients → TEE Aggregation Service

TEE Aggregation: Secure Gradient Averaging → Global Model Update in TEE
Banks: Transaction Data → TEE Inference → Risk Scores → Banks
```

**Characteristics:**
- **What moves**: Gradient updates from individual training batches
- **Frequency**: More frequent during training (after each batch or epoch)
- **Communication**: Higher bandwidth for both training and inference
- **TEE Memory**: Requires storage for gradient vectors and inference workload
- **Privacy**: Gradients and transaction data processed securely in TEE

**Comparative Analysis:**

| Aspect | FL in TEE - Weight Sharing | FL in TEE - Gradient Sharing |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Communication Frequency** | Low (periodic) | High (frequent) |
| **Bandwidth Requirements** | Medium-High (weights + inference data) | High (gradients + inference data) |
| **TEE Memory Constraints** | Higher (full model + inference) | Lower (gradients + inference) |
| **Privacy Risk** | Lower (complete models in TEE) | Higher (gradients + potential inference attacks) |
| **Training Synchronization** | Loose (epoch-level) | Tight (batch-level) |
| **Implementation Complexity** | Medium | Higher |
| **Convergence Speed** | Slower | Faster |
| **Inference Latency** | Medium (TEE processing) | Medium (TEE processing) |

**Trade-offs (Both Variants):**
- **Higher Complexity**: Requires TEE infrastructure and secure aggregation protocols
- **TEE Dependencies**: Relies on specific hardware (Intel SGX, AMD SEV, ARM TrustZone) availability
- **Performance Overhead**: TEE operations typically have computational overhead
- **Model Size Constraints**: Current TEE memory limitations may restrict large model architectures

**Use Cases:**
- **High-value fraud detection** where model improvement benefits justify additional complexity
- **Cross-border consortiums** requiring cryptographic security proofs for regulators
- **Competitive environments** where banks want collective learning with maximum privacy protection
- **Regulatory-heavy jurisdictions** demanding hardware-attested security guarantees

**Implementation Example - Bias-Aware Federated Averaging:**
```python
# Pseudocode for fairness-aware model aggregation
def fairness_aware_aggregation(bank_models, fairness_scores, accuracy_scores):
    # Combine accuracy and fairness into composite score
    composite_scores = alpha * accuracy_scores + (1-alpha) * fairness_scores
    
    # Weight models based on composite performance
    weights = normalize(composite_scores)
    
    # Aggregate with fairness-adjusted weights
    global_model = weighted_average(bank_models, weights)
    
    # Validate global model fairness
    if not meets_fairness_threshold(global_model):
        apply_post_processing_debiasing(global_model)
    
    return global_model
```

- **Consortium valuable**: For cross-institutional schemes and sophisticated attacks
- **Decision criteria**: Volume of cross-bank fraud vs. implementation complexity

**Medium Banks:**
- Higher relative benefit from shared intelligence
- Network effects more pronounced
- Collective defense against resource-intensive attacks

### 7.3 ROI Calculation
```
ROI = (Fraud Loss Reduction + Operational Savings - Implementation Costs) / Implementation Costs

Where:
- Fraud Loss Reduction = ΔDetection Rate × Average Loss per Incident × Annual Volume
- Operational Savings = False Positive Reduction × Investigation Cost per Alert
- Implementation Costs = Build + Governance + Annual Operations
```
